# Who is Daniel Tay?

<p align="center"><img src="/Profile.jpg" alt="Profile" width="240px" class="center"/></p>

Hey there! My name is Daniel Tay, and I am an Analytics Consultant at Cornerstone Research.

At my current job, I code a lot in R and SQL (Netezza) and occasionally in Python. Apart from the technical challenges of my job, I most enjoy the mentoring and teaching opportunities that present themselves. I know that I eventually want to teach full-time, but I'm exploring whatever tickles my fancy until I can no longer ignore the teaching itch :)

Prior to becoming a part of Corporate America:TM:, I was a Data Science major at The College of William & Mary. I initially fought very hard to not be a walking stereotype and decided to major in Psychology, but I eventually realised that academia was just not my cup of tea. Fortunately, while recovering from my stint in the Psychology department, I learnt about my interest for programming and data analysis, and the rest is, as they say, (a very short) history.

When I'm not busy worrying about how Season 3 of the Panny D (i.e., this current pandemic) will turn out, I spend most of my spare time playing video games, learning Japanese, knitting, and obsessing over food.

P.S. My natural hair colour is black, but I think my true spirit hair colour is blue.

# Data Science Portfolio

Here is a sample of the data science projects that I have done.

## R

[The Average Pokemon](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Daniel-Tay/daniel-tay.github.io/blob/master/The%20Average%20Pokemon.ipynb): In this project, I examine which Pokemon has base stats that most closely resemble the "average" Pokemon used in competitive play.
