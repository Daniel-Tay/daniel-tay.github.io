# Who is Daniel Tay?

<p align="center"><img src="/Profile.jpg" alt="Profile" width="240px" class="center"/></p>

Hey there! My name is Daniel Tay, and I'm currently a Data Science major at The College of William & Mary. Before realising that data analysis was something that I enjoyed, I was a Psychology and Economics major. I originally flirted with the idea of pursuing a PhD in Psychology, but I eventually realised that academia wasn't my cup of tea.

If you've noticed my British spelling, it's because I was born and raised in Singapore, a tiny city-state in Southeast Asia. Growing up in a country where the national narrative is one where hard work is the key to our nation's survival, I have developed an amazing work ethic at the expense of devoting time towards exploring my actual interests. Coming to America helped with the latter without compromising the former. Even though I eventually stopped pursuing an academic career in Psychology, I have retained my interest in understanding human behaviour, and am looking for opportunities to put my research and data analytical capabilities to good use after I graduate.

When I'm not busy worrying about what I'm going to do after I graduate from college, I spend most of my spare time watching an unhealthy amount of television (currently watching: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Suits, and The Good Place to name a few), playing video games, or obsessing over food.

P.S. My natural hair colour is black, but I think my true spirit hair colour is blue.

# Data Science Portfolio

Here is a sample of the data science projects that I have done.

## Python

[*The Kalevala*](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Daniel-Tay/daniel-tay.github.io/blob/master/Kalevala.ipynb): In this project, I analyse an excerpt of *The Kalevala* for vowel harmony.

[Virginia Beach's Fire Department](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Daniel-Tay/daniel-tay.github.io/blob/master/Fire.ipynb): In this project, I analyse data from Virginia Beach's Fire Department.

[US Army Corps of Engineers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Daniel-Tay/daniel-tay.github.io/blob/master/Monte%20Carlo%20Simulation.ipynb): In this project, I conduct a Monte Carlo Simulation to assess the accuracy of a model used to guide decision making.

## R
