    "# The Average Pokémon Used by Serious Competitors\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been following the Pokémon series for a really long time (almost 20 years at this point!), and I thought it would be good to put my impractical knowledge to (good?) use in a small data analysis project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I first discovered the world of competitive online Pokémon battles in 2008, way back when Pokémon was still in its 3rd Gen(eration), where each generation is marked by the release of new Pokémon. While I stopped playing the games some time during the 5th/6th Gen (we are currently in the 8th Gen marked by Sword and Shield), I still consider myself a part of the competitive battling scene. That being said, I am definitely a lot less \"in the know\" as I was years ago, though I would like to think that I can still hold my own against an amateur battler :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that I seek to address via this project is: **Which Pokémon has base stats that most closely resembles the \"average\" Pokémon used by the most skilled players in the Over-Used (OU) battling scene?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the methodology and actual analyses, here's a couple of paragraphs containing relevant background information for those who might be unfamiliar with this scene:\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Brief Background on Competitive Online Pokémon Battling\n",
    "\n",
    "Competitive online Pokémon battlings involves two people each using a team of up to 6 Pokémon. Pokémon are categorised into tiers based on viability, usage frequency, available counters etc. The important thing to note is that Pokémon tiers are not set in stone as team strategies evolve and develop over time, and Pokémon do change tiers over time as well. I won't do a deep dive into the details of it (you can view more information on tiers [here](https://www.smogon.com/bw/articles/bw_tiers)), but I raise this because I have chosen to analyse Pokémon in the Over-Used (OU) tier, which is the most popular tier (and also happens to be the one that I'm most familiar with).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Brief Background on Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "In the competitive online Pokémon battling scene, [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/) is widely recognized as a leading \"authority in the competitive Pokémon arena.\" They operate [Pokémon Showdown!](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/), one of the most popular online Pokémon battle simulators. Literal millions of battles occur on that website every month, and I understand that there is a mature data collection pipeline for all of those battles along with documentation of the various fields (see this [forum post](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/gen-8-smogon-university-usage-statistics-discussion-thread.3657197/) for an overview). This makes it a great source for Pokémon battling data! The Internet truly is a magical place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Overview on Pokémon Stats\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six different stats (`HP`, `Attack`, `Defense`, `SpAtk`, `SpDef`, and `Speed`) that a Pokémon has.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of damaging moves in the game: Physical and Special. The amount of damage dealt by each move is dependent on several things, but to simplify the explanation, the amount of damage done by Physical moves is determined by the attacking Pokémon's `Attack` stat and the defending Pokémon's `Defense` stat. The amount of damage done by Special moves is determined by the attacking Pokémon's Special Attack (`SpAtk`) stat and the defending Pokémon's Special Defense (`SpDef`) stat. When two Pokémon are facing each other, the one with the higher `Speed` stat moves first. `HP` stands for Hit Points, and it basically refers to the amount of health that a Pokémon has. Total is simply the sum of all of the stats, and can be used as a general indicator of a Pokémon's battle potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the data, numbers indicated under each stats' column refers to the base stat of that Pokémon. There are entire pages dedicated towards what this truly means, but suffice to say, a base stat represents a Pokémon's \"potential\" in that stat. While it is possible for a Pokémon's stat to be inflated by items, natures, and training, the base stat is an indicator of the highest possible stat that the Pokémon can attain for that particular attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who are the most skilled players in the OU battling scene?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pokémon usage statistics on Smogon are helpfully tiered based on player skill level. Player skill level is determined via one's ranking on the ladder. I won't dive into the specifics of it, but I'm essentially taking usage statistics from  the most skilled players in the OU tier (i.e., players that are ranked 1825 and above). To quote [Question 8 of the Gen 8 Smogon University Usage Statistics Discussion Thread FAQ](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/gen-8-smogon-university-usage-statistics-discussion-thread.3657197/):\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"1760 (1825 for OU) stats represent \"1337\" stats, what the best-of-the-best in the metagame are doing. To some extent, this is what all players should strive to be doing, but there are some Pokemon and strategies that are difficult to pull off and might require a greater amount of skill than the typical competitive player possesses.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "Wow, that was certainly _a lot_. But now that we have all of the background information out of the way, let's look at the methodology I am employing to answer the question."

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "I looked at Gen 8 OU battle data for each month in 2021 (you can see a sample file for January 2021 at this link [here](https://www.smogon.com/stats/2021-01/gen8ou-1825.txt)). I also pulled the data for the last two months of 2019 when Gen 8 was first released. I downloaded each of the `.txt` files and read them in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the Smogon dataset lacks the necessary base stat information, so I supplemented that by scraping data off [Pokémon Database](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all) since all of the base stat information was already organised in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Determining the Average Pokémon\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each month, I decided to filter the data to the top 100 most used Pokémon in the OU tier for a particular month.\n",
    "2. I then assigned a weight to each of those 100 Pokémon based on how often it appeared on teams based on the `Usage %` field (see this [lengthy discussion on how weighting is used](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/weighted-stats-faq.3478570/)), and took the weighted average of each stat across all 100 Pokémon, and took that to be the \"average\" Pokémon's base stats.\n",
    "3. I then calculated a difference score for every single Pokémon against the \"average\" Pokémon's base stats. This difference score was calculated by taking the sum of squared differences for each stat.\n",
    "   * This difference score calculation methodology was selected as it imposes a bigger penalty on larger deviations from the \"average\" Pokémon's base stat.\n",
    "4. The Pokémon with the smallest difference score is the answer to the question!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "I hypothesize that my analyses will yield the following two results:\n",
    "1. The same Pokémon will appear for all months in 2021.\n",
    "   * It has been over 2 years since the Gen 8 metagame has been released, so it should be at a fairly mature and stable point.\n",
    "   * Consequently, I doubt that the most frequently used Pokémon would fluctuate by a lot, and so I would expect that the \"average\" base stats would be fairly constant across those months.\n",
    "2. The Pokémon for the last two months of 2019 will be different from the one listed in 2021.\n",
    "   * I expect the metagame to be quite different from when it first started (e.g., Pokémon that are frequently used might be moved to different tiers if they become excessively dominant)."
