<p>Hey there! My name is Daniel Tay, and I'm currently a Data Science major at The College of William &amp; Mary. Before realising that data analysis was something that I enjoyed, I was a Psychology and Economics major. I originally flirted with the idea of pursuing a PhD in Psychology, but I eventually realised that academia wasn't my cup of tea.</p>
<p>If you've noticed my British spelling, it's because I was born and raised in Singapore, a tiny city-state in Southeast Asia. Growing up in a country where the national narrative is one where hard work is the key to our nation's survival, I have developed an amazing work ethic at the expense of devoting time towards exploring my actual interests. Coming to America helped with the latter without compromising the former. Even though I eventually stopped pursuing an academic career in Psychology, I have retained my interest in understanding human behaviour, and am looking for opportunities to put my research and data analytical capabilities to good use after I graduate.</p>
<p>When I'm not busy worrying about what I'm going to do after I graduate from college, I spend most of my spare time watching an unhealthy amount of television (currently watching: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Suits, and The Good Place to name a few), playing video games, or obsessing over food.</p>
<p>P.S. My natural hair colour is black, but I think my true spirit hair colour is blue.</p>
